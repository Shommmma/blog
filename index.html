          <h1>Creation of Calvin Klein</h1>

          <p>
            Kelvin came up with wonderful coats, but dreamed of his own company,
            where everything would be the way he wants. Until the last day of
            working on his own brand, he was really responsible for everything -
            choosing photographers, locations, models, designing stores and
            perfume bottles.

          <p>
            Despite many controversial campaigns, the main thing for Klein from
            the very beginning was not advertising, but quality. He is a fan of
            perfect quality clothes. And it has always been like this. Calvin
            Klein, then unknown to anyone, created his first collection with
            $10,000 borrowed from a friend. There were several coats and dresses
            in it. Everything is of perfect quality. Well sewn, thought out and
            tailored.

          <h1>History</h1>
          <p>
            Calvin Klein, Ltd. was founded in 1968[2] by Calvin Klein and his
            childhood friend Barry Schwartz in New York City. At first the
            studio produced men's outerwear, then gradually moved on to
            designing clothes for women. In the 1970s, the classic men's suit
            was adapted for women's fashion; Introduced in 1970, the
            double-breasted short coat with wide lapels not only became the hit
            of the season, but also had a strong influence on women's outerwear
            fashion for almost a decade. In 1974, Klein created a collection of
            accessories and fur clothing.[3] In 1978, Klein became the world's
            first to catwalk and sell “designer jeans,” which allowed girls to
            show off the length of their legs and the slenderness of their
            thighs.

          <h1>The highest of sales</h1>
          <p>
            PVH Corp's sales rose 4% to $2 billion (1.79 billion euros or about
            113 billion rubles) in the first quarter. The growth was driven by
            revenue from Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger, but sales from
            Heritage Brands fell.
