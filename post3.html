          <h1>History of CREATION CALVIN KLEIN</h1>
          <p>
            Calvin Klein is one of the world’s leading global fashion lifestyle
            brands with a history of bold, non-conformist ideals that inform
            everything we do. Founded in New York in 1968, the brand’s
            minimalist and sensual aesthetic drives our approach to product
            design and communication, creating a canvas that offers the
            possibility of limitless self-expression. The Calvin Klein brands –
            CK Calvin Klein, Calvin Klein, Calvin Klein Jeans, Calvin Klein
            Underwear, and Calvin Klein Performance – are connected by the
            intention and purpose of elevating everyday essentials to globally
            iconic status. Each of the brands has a distinct identity and
            position in the retail landscape, providing us the opportunity to
            market a range of universally appealing products to domestic and
            international consumers with a variety of needs. Our products are
            underpinned by responsible design, high-quality construction, and
            the elimination of all unnecessary details. We strive for unique and
            dimensional pieces that continuously wear well and remain relevant
            season after season. Global retail sales of Calvin Klein products
            were approximately $8.5 billion in 2021. Calvin Klein continues to
            solidify its position as an innovator of emerging digital platforms
            and modern marketing campaigns. PVH acquired Calvin Klein in 2003
            and continues to oversee a focused approach to growing the brand’s
            worldwide relevance, presence, and long term growth.
