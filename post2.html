          <h1>Calvin Richard Klein</h1>
          <p>
            Klein was born on November 19, 1942, to a Jewish family in the
            Bronx, New York City, the son of Flore (née Stern; 1909–2006) and
            Leo Klein.[1][2] Leo had immigrated to New York from Hungary, while
            Flore was born in the United States to immigrants from Galicia and
            Bukovina, Austria-Hungary (modern day-Ukraine).[3][4] Klein went to
            Isobel Rooney Middle School 80 (M.S.80) as a child. He attended the
            High School of Art and Design in Manhattan and was enrolled at, but
            never graduated from, New York's Fashion Institute of Technology,
            instead receiving an honorary doctorate in 2003. He did his
            apprenticeship in 1962 at an old line cloak-and-suit manufacturer,
            Dan Millstein,[5] and spent five years designing at other New York
            City shops.[6] In 1968, he launched his first company with his
            childhood best friend,[7] Barry K. Schwartz.[7][8] He became a
            protégé of Baron de Gunzburg,[8] through whose introductions he
            became the toast of the New York elite fashion scene even before he
            had his first mainstream success with the launch of his first jeans
            line. He was immediately recognized for his talent after his first
            major showing at New York Fashion Week. He was hailed as the new
            Yves Saint Laurent, and was noted for his clean lines.[citation
