          <h1>Highest of SALES</h1>
          <p>
            Tommy Hilfiger and Calvin Klein parent PVH said Q2 2023 sales rose 4
            per cent year-on-year to $2.207 billion, beating analyst
            expectations and prior guidance of low single-digit growth. Shares
            rose 3.1 per cent on Tuesday in response. Sales at Calvin Klein were
            up 3 per cent for the quarter, while Tommy Hilfiger sales increased
            6 per cent. The group’s heritage brands (a smaller portfolio of
            intimates brands Warners, Olga and True & Co following the sale of
            other brands to Authentic Brands Group in 2021) were down 11 per
            cent year-on-year, the eighth consecutive quarter of declines. “For
            the second quarter we delivered another strong performance,” CEO
            Stefan Larsson told investors on Wednesday, crediting the success of
            the company’s PVH+ plan, a growth initiative announced in 2022 with
            the goal of reaching $12.5 billion in sales by 2025. “It’s a really
            pivotal moment where you now see the proof points we have been
            working on for the past year,” Larsson said. PVH’s
            direct-to-consumer sales — a key area of focus in the PVH+ plan —
            were up 11 per cent year-on-year. “Our DTC business will create a
            halo for us that will benefit the entire marketplace. We are excited
            about the accelerated momentum we are building there.” Wholesale
            fared worse, falling 3 per cent year-on-year — but this was “more
            than” offset by the DTC growth, Dana Telsey, analyst and CEO and
            chief research officer of Telsey Advisory Group, said in the group’s
            earnings review. Chief financial officer Zac Coughlin cited
            wholesalers’ ongoing cautious approach — particularly in the US — as
            a reason for the dip.
